# p5.js Template ðŸŽ¨

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is a library for graphical displays in the browser, it provides an easy to use [interface](https://p5js.org/reference/) for HTML5 Canvas. A lot of [examples](https://p5js.org/examples/) for 2D and 3D projects already exist. It also provides an interace for audio processing. Have a look at one of Lukas' projects to get inspired: http://lukas.uzolas.com/sinus/ .
